This gives them the ability to enjoy the complete artwork, and the individual piece they choose as their DAB is their unique membership card, personalized with their details.</p><h3>Connecting with your artwork</h3><p>In conjunction with the museum or artist, we put together a selection of unique features that are included with each artwork. The full list is available <a href='/features'>here</a>, while each artwork listing notes the specific features that come with that artwork.</p><h3>Congrats, you’re supporting your cause</h3><p>Each DAB purchased is a charitable donation, and is tax deductible within the guidelines of U.S. law. Following your purchase, you’ll receive the receipt needed to claim it on your taxes.</p><h3>Let’s protect our cultural heritage</h3><p>We believe great art should always be available to the public, and not sold in to private collections — that is why CoMission collectors acquire a membership in each piece. These DABs and their associated memberships are not intended for resale by the collector, and don’t include any legal ownership to the artwork or the copyright, ensuring that the art can be appreciated by the public for years to come.</p>"
