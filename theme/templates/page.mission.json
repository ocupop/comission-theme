To transcend barriers of gender, race, class and politics. To transform the ways in which we connect to one another and experience culture. To inspire us to make a social impact in our world.<\/p><p>Yet despite all the power art has to provoke, to connect, and to heal, it is often bound by the spaces and galleries in which it is displayed – museums and galleries that are increasingly subject to financial strain.<\/p><p>That’s why we created CoMission - to break those geographic, spatial and financial boundaries, and to bring the experience of art — of viewing, exploring and collecting — to people everywhere.<\/p><p>Through this we generate a new source of income – for the Artist, the social cause that inspires them, and the institution that displays their physical work. We would love to have you join us.<\/p>",
